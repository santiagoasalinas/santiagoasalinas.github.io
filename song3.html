        <p>
            Sucker love is heaven sent
            You pucker up our passion's spent <br>
            My hearts a tart your body's rent
            My body's broken yours is bent
        </p>

        <p>
            Carve your name into my arm
            Instead of stressed I lie here charmed <br>
            Cause there's nothing else to do
            Every me and every you
        </p>

        <p>
          Sucker love a box I choose
          No other box I choose to use
          Another love I would abuse
          No circumstances could excuse  
        </p>
        <p>
            In the shape of things to come
            Too much poison come undone
            Cause there's nothing else to do
            Every me and every you
            Every me and every you
            Every me
        </p>
        <p>
           Sucker love is known to swing
           Prone to cling and waste these things
           Pucker up for heavens sake
           There's never been so much at stake 
        </p>
        <p>
            I serve my head up on a plate
            It's only comfort, calling late
            Cause there's nothing else to do
            Every me and every you
            Every me and every you
            Every me,
        </p>
