                Sucker love is heaven sent <br>
                You pucker up our passion's spent <br>
                My hearts a tart your body's rent <br>
                My body's broken yours is bent <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Carve your name into my arm <br>
                Instead of stressed I lie here charmed <br>
                Cause there's nothing else to do <br>
                Every me and every you <br>
            </p>

            <p>
              Sucker love a box I choose <br>
              No other box I choose to use <br>
              Another love I would abuse <br>
              No circumstances could excuse  <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the shape of things to come <br>
                Too much poison come undone <br>
                Cause there's nothing else to do <br>
                Every me and every you <br>
                Every me and every you <br>
                Every me <br>
            </p>
            <p>
               Sucker love is known to swing <br>
               Prone to cling and waste these things <br>
               Pucker up for heavens sake <br>
               There's never been so much at stake <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I serve my head up on a plate <br>
                It's only comfort, calling late <br>
                Cause there's nothing else to do <br>
                Every me and every you <br>
                Every me and every you <br>
                Every me, <br>
            </p>
